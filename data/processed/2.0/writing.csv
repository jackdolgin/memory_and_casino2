One time she got attacked by a cat while she was out walking our dog and had to go get her wounds treated. The next time she fainted and had to be rushed to the hospital. Those were both scary things. In that time we also managed to have some fun. We went to a Wilco concert, a Drive-by truckers concert, and went and saw the band Ambrosia at EPCOT center.

I have been working non stop on assignments and my research work with a team of people. Life is getting to a point where I have more freedom and that's scary. My marriage has been rocky to the point of separation and I have met another man and started dating him. This has made me happy but also distracted me from the routine things I have to do.

My class has just been planning all the senior day stuff, which was a bit stressful, but also fun. It is also a bittersweet time because it is our final time and memories with the seniors and 5th years since we won't be playing with them again. In regard to school, I am nearing finals.
