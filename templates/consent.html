          <p>Project Title: Introspection and Eye Tracking</p>
          <p>Principal Investigator: Ilya Monosov</p>
          <p>Research Team Contact: Jack Dolgin - (314) 362-3740 - monosovlab.mturk@gmail.com</p>

              <h2>KEY INFORMATION</h2>
              <p>
                  This is a research study conducted by Ilya Monosov having to do with eye tracking and introspection. You should carefully consider the information in this consent document and discuss it with the research team. You should understand why you might want to participate, or why you might not want to participate. You may choose to participate or not.
              </p>
              <p>
                  If you agree and sign this consent, you will be volunteering to participate in the research study. As a voluntary participant, you will be asked to spend 10 minutes to complete one or more computerized tasks that will involve viewing stimuli on the screen (e.g., shapes, words, images, complex patterns) and indicating a response based on the task instructions, in addition to a brief questionnaire assessing your subjective experiences, various general preferences, and demographic information. The tasks involved in this study can require some mental effort, and you may therefore experience boredom or fatigue during the experiment. However, for those tasks, you will receive ample time for rest periods and/or stretch breaks.
              </p>
              <p>
                  We don't expect this study to benefit you directly, but it will help us understand the mechanisms involved in introspection. By volunteering, you may help someone else in the future. There is no cost to you and will be paid for being a volunteer participant. All of this information will be explained and is listed in more detail in this consent document.
              </p>
              <h2>STUDY DESCRIPTION</h2>
              <p>
                  We invite you to participate in this research study because you are a healthy adult between the ages of 18-55. The purpose of this research study is to investigate how people introspect and the corresponding eye correlates. The National Institute of Mental Health is funding this research study.
              </p>
              <p>
                  If you agree to participate, we would like you to complete one or more computerized tasks that will involve viewing stimuli on the screen (e.g., shapes, words, images, complex patterns) and indicating a response based on the task instructions. Responses may involve making choices, performing a cognitive operation, and/or performing a motor response. Some of these tasks may offer additional incentives above your base pay (see Compensation). You may also be asked to complete brief questionnaires assessing your subjective experiences, various general preferences, and demographic information. You are free to skip any questions that you prefer not to answer. Some tasks will require you to turn your webcam on, in order to collect information about eye movements. Only numerical data describing the position of your eye on the screen will be recorded. No video or audio recordings will be made. The entire procedure should last 10 minutes. If you do not want to participate, simply close this study. We will not reach out for further contact.
              </p>
              <p>
                  We might remove identifiers from your private information and then use the information for future research studies or share them with other researchers for their future research. If this occurs we will not ask you for additional consent for these uses of your information.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Approximately 2000 people will take part in this study at Washington University.
              </p>
              <p>
                  There are no known risks from being in this study, and you will not benefit personally.  However we hope that others may benefit in the future from what we learn as a result of this study.
              </p>
              <p>
                  You will not have any costs for being in this research study.
              </p>
              <p>
                  You will be paid for being in this research study. Your Prolific ID will be recorded as a way for us to confirm you have completed the experiment and then properly compensate you. You will be paid a base amount of $2.50 and may also receive bonus payment based on your performance, ranging from $0 to $1.
              </p>
              <p>
                  We will keep the information you provide confidential by ensuring data are stored and transferred securely and by limiting access to the research team only. Your Prolific ID is deidentified, does not contain any information about your name, and will be dissociated from your responses and task data, though it is associated with your Prolific profile. Any report or article that we write will not include information that can directly identify you.  The journals that publish these reports or articles require that we share your information that was collected for this study with others to make sure the results of this study are correct and help develop new ideas for research. Your information will be shared in a way that cannot directly identify you.
              </p>
              <p>
                  To further protect your privacy, this research is covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal government. This means that the researchers can refuse to disclose information that may identify you in any legal or court proceeding or to anyone who is not connected with the research except if:
                  <ul>
                      <li>there is a law that requires disclosure, such as to report child abuse and neglect, or harm to self or others</li>
                      <li>you give permission to disclose your information, including as described in this document</li>
                      <li>it is used for other scientific research allowed by federal law</li>
                  </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                  You have the right to share your information or involvement in this study with anyone at any time. You may also give the research team permission to disclose your information to a third party or any other person not connected with the research.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Federal regulatory agencies and Washington University, including the Washington University Institutional Review Board (a committee that reviews and approves research studies) and the Human Research Protection Office may inspect and copy records pertaining to this research.  If we write a report about this study we will do so in such a way that you cannot be identified.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Your participation in this study is completely voluntary.  You may choose not to take part at all.  If you decide to participate in the study you may stop participating at any time. Any data that was collected as part of this study will remain as part of the study records and cannot be removed.  If you decide not to take part in the study or if you stop participating at any time, you won't be penalized or lose any benefits for which you otherwise qualify.
              </p>
              <p>
                  If you do not wish to participate in this study or want to end your participation in the study, simply close this study. Again, you will not be penalized or lose any benefits for which you otherwise qualify.
              </p>
              <p>
